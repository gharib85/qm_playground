Visualisation
=============

To visualise the results of any qm_playground simulation we provide a Bokeh
server that is capable of loading '.end' files.

Running 'bokeh serve --show qm_playground/visualsation/plot.py' from the
command line should produce a browser window that will allow the user to
visualise their results. This is done by simply typing the file path of the
'.end' file and clickling the button.
